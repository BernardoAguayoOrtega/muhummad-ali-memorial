                <q>
                        Sonny Liston is nothing. The man can't talk. The man can't fight. The man needs talking lessons. The man needs boxing lessons. And since he's gonna fight me, he needs falling lessons.

                    "The Greatest" wasn't just a nickname for Muhammad Ali.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Louisville, Kentucky, native took his gold medal from the 1960 Summer Olympics and embarked on a pro career that yielded 61 fights, 56 victories and three reigns as the world's top heavyweight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So while compiling a list of his 10 best fights may be a challenge, it's not from a lack of material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We took a stab at it while considering not only the singular quality of Ali's performances but the significance of the events both individually and in the context of his overall resume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take a look at our picks and our rationale on the following slides, and feel free to drop in with your own ideas in the comments section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rest easy, champion.

                        4. Joe Frazier (L UD 15, March 8, 1971)
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        It's not often a loss would make a 10-best list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it's not often a loss comes with the circumstances of Ali-Frazier I.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking into account that he'd fought fewer than 18 full rounds in the previous three-plus years, it's amazing enough that Ali lasted a full 15 with a prime and ferocious version of Smokin' Joe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And even though Frazier dropped him with a hellacious left hand in the final round, Ali rose and took his medicine in the form of a unanimous-decision defeat that was the first of his career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other fights have passed it in terms of revenue and viewership, but this one still reigns as the pinnacle moment of the heavyweight division.
