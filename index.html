                <q>
                        Sonny Liston is nothing. The man can't talk. The man can't fight. The man needs talking lessons. The man needs boxing lessons. And since he's gonna fight me, he needs falling lessons.

                    "The Greatest" wasn't just a nickname for Muhammad Ali.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Louisville, Kentucky, native took his gold medal from the 1960 Summer Olympics and embarked on a pro career that yielded 61 fights, 56 victories and three reigns as the world's top heavyweight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So while compiling a list of his 10 best fights may be a challenge, it's not from a lack of material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We took a stab at it while considering not only the singular quality of Ali's performances but the significance of the events both individually and in the context of his overall resume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take a look at our picks and our rationale on the following slides, and feel free to drop in with your own ideas in the comments section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rest easy, champion.

                        5. Leon Spinks (UD 15, Sept. 15, 1978)
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Ali had lost twice in 57 fights before stubbing his toe on seven-fight novice Leon Spinks less than two years after the kid struck gold at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But while the loss added an unlikely smudge to his resume, it also set the stage for what should have been an ovation-worthy farewell seven months later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A 36-year-old Ali took 10, 10 and 11 of 15 rounds on three scorecards and became the first man to win the heavyweight title three times. </p>
                    <p>
                        Not his best work, but if this would have been goodbye, no one would have complained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, he ultimately came back for two more, but this was the last of his 56 career victories.
