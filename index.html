                        Sonny Liston is nothing. The man can't talk. The man can't fight. The man needs talking lessons. The man needs boxing lessons. And since he's gonna fight me, he needs falling lessons.

                    "The Greatest" wasn't just a nickname for Muhammad Ali.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Louisville, Kentucky, native took his gold medal from the 1960 Summer Olympics and embarked on a pro career that yielded 61 fights, 56 victories and three reigns as the world's top heavyweight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So while compiling a list of his 10 best fights may be a challenge, it's not from a lack of material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We took a stab at it while considering not only the singular quality of Ali's performances but the significance of the events both individually and in the context of his overall resume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take a look at our picks and our rationale on the following slides, and feel free to drop in with your own ideas in the comments section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rest easy, champion.

                    <h2>
                        4. Joe Frazier (L UD 15, March 8, 1971)
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        It's not often a loss would make a 10-best list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it's not often a loss comes with the circumstances of Ali-Frazier I.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking into account that he'd fought fewer than 18 full rounds in the previous three-plus years, it's amazing enough that Ali lasted a full 15 with a prime and ferocious version of Smokin' Joe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And even though Frazier dropped him with a hellacious left hand in the final round, Ali rose and took his medicine in the form of a unanimous-decision defeat that was the first of his career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other fights have passed it in terms of revenue and viewership, but this one still reigns as the pinnacle moment of the heavyweight division.

                        3. Sonny Liston (TKO 7, Feb. 25, 1964)
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        It's not often a loss would make a 10-The legend had to begin somewhere, right?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it's not often a loss comes with the circumstances of Ali-Frazier I.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this case, it was when a brash, unproven 22-year-old kid stepped into the ring against a veteran slugger who'd won and defended the heavyweight title with consecutive one-round KOs of his predecessor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was little wonder, then, that Sonny Liston was a prohibitive favorite.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But after 18 minutes of ring action, the sport would never be the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ali, in his last fight as Cassius Clay, confounded the slower Liston with improbably fast hands and feet and ultimately prompted his surrender—reportedly due to a balky shoulder—before Round 7.
