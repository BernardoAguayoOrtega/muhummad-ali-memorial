                <q>
                        Sonny Liston is nothing. The man can't talk. The man can't fight. The man needs talking lessons. The man needs boxing lessons. And since he's gonna fight me, he needs falling lessons.

                    "The Greatest" wasn't just a nickname for Muhammad Ali.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Louisville, Kentucky, native took his gold medal from the 1960 Summer Olympics and embarked on a pro career that yielded 61 fights, 56 victories and three reigns as the world's top heavyweight.

                <p>
                    So while compiling a list of his 10 best fights may be a challenge, it's not from a lack of material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We took a stab at it while considering not only the singular quality of Ali's performances but the significance of the events both individually and in the context of his overall resume.
